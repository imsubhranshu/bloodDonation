This website is working completely fine and can be deployed to server

## Work to be done
1. Need to add some pages like:
      1. An update page which first requires user Authentication then allows the user to change its details
      2. An about page
      3. A contact page
2. Setup database for contacts
3. Add a functionality so that whenever a user contact us he should get an automatic email reading "Thank you for contacting us. Our team will reach you shortly".
4. A details page so that whernever a user clicks on a donor's name it should display all details(except password) about the donor in a formatted way also allow the user to print or take a pdf of the donor's details.
